- There should be an option when you save the Rmd file in report to also
react/add a data file with values[[]] that has the data needed for the Rmd file. That way you can actually recreate the report without the GUI! Think about how to do that.
- datafilters: each function should state in the summary if a filter was used and, if so, what the name of the filter is. See single\_mean. The 'key' for the filter is just the name of the dataset + the filter label. There may be multiple filters for a dataset. In values[[dataset\_filter]] there should be a list with 1. the filter name, 2. a description of the filter (e.g., males only), and 3. the code that creates the filter (**How does that code get applied? or is this just to augment the filter description. Also useful if you want to tweak the filter to create a new one i guess**), 4. and (likely) a logical that indicates which obs should be included.
- Should you send all parameters to report or only the non-default values? What about the ones that are NULL, or empty, of FALSE (i.e., not selected)?
